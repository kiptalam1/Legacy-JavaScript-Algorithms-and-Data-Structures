# Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. 
In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures repo, I learnt the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

I applied the knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

I also learnt two important programming styles or paradigms: **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Functional Programming (FP)**.
